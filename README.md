User will be prompted of how much cards to draw, random option available<br>

### Notes

Exercises should be done with minimal time in between cards (1-5 seconds)<br>
You can PT alone, or with a group. If with a group, you will hold a plank until everyone is done with the exercise. When everyone is holding a plank position, you can move on to the next card.
